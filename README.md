# Data Dashboard Developer with Paymo API Integration

We use a third-party project management application called Paymo, which has an API available. We would like to build a small dashboard that extends some of the capabilities of Paymo. The dashboard/application will require authentication, integration with Paymo's API, areas for manual data entry that doesn't come from Paymo, and user-access levels. We have a wireframe available for the dashboard view.

Requirements:

-   Proficiency in API integration, particularly with Paymo's API
-   Experience in web application development, with a focus on data dashboard creation
-   Fluent in English, work in US time zone

We'd like to host the production application on our LAMP server after it's completed.
